# Facial Recognition

 ---

## Overview

---

A data-driven facial recognition algorithm in Python using singular value
decomposition for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
Principal component projection on eigenfaces is applied to 
determine facial similarity and classification.
Facial images are reconstructed from reduced singular value representation
to optimize storage and efficiency.
## Data Sets

---

This dataset is from a collection of JPEG photos of famous peoples' faces
collected from the internet. Each picture is centered on a single face.
The full dataset can be found at: <br>

For the purpose of this implementation of Facial Recognition, the two most 
popular faces have been selected: George Bush and Serena Williams. 
The corresponding training and testing data sets that will be used for these two faces can be found here: <br>
